# Change: a social web-based game about environment

Nowadays, from an environmental aspect, earth had been changed greatly. There’re declining of natural resources, increasing of pollutions and many natural disasters. Only a handful of people tried to change their way of living to reflex on those events.

Because of this, “Change” was created as a social web-based game (so that players can enjoy the game without the trouble of installing) to let its players experiment on researching and inventing new technologies, advancing the virtual globe in the process. As the world developing, environmental status (such as global resources, global pollutions, etc.) would deteriorate over time to reflex on players’ actions. At one point, these issues would affect players’ wellbeing and this would encourage players to collaborate with each others to survive the world’s disasters. Hopefully, this game will give its players consciousness on environmental problems and influence its players to think that it is time to “Change” their way of living before it’s too late as in the game.

This is my project developed in 2010.
